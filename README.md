# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
Overview of Project
	Purpose
		- Anaylsis is refining data into a format that is easier to comprehend. It provides clarity and simplification to quickly interpret the meaning and potential use it to impact other data.
		
	Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
		My biggest challenge was ensuring I was spelling things correctly and that they matched other sections of the workbook that I was directing my code/fucntions towards. 
		I started using the notepad application to provide a space to write and edit prior to inserting into my excel document. 
	Results
		What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
			1. The summer months (May thru July) had the best outcomes in relation to their launch dates. 
			2. The ones that failed were more consistant and did not vary as much as the ones that were successful.
		What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
			Using the 'Outcomes based on Goals' analysis, it is clear that projects with goals under $5000 we more successful than those above that amount. 
		What are some limitations of this dataset?
			There are many variables that can affect the outcome of a project and it is extremely challenging to capture them all. 
			This data set did not include other factors that could have impacted the outcomes.
		What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
			1. We could have created a bar graph to capture the 'Outcomes based on Launch date' and the 'Country' to see if there is any correalation between good weather and success.
			2. We could also have created a pie chart to capture the number of backers,amount pledged, and country to see if a particular country was more supportive.
